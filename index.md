## Values

  - I love cultivating and maintaining relationships. I come from a huge family and I value spending time with family and friends. 
  - With that said, I also value personal time and a good work-life **Balance**.  I enjoy living a healthy and active lifestyle, thus I like to challenge myself physically because it helps me to develop mental calluses.
  - I value **humility** and **candor** from others.
  - I value autonomy 

## Personality
I’m goal-oriented and intrinsically motivated  which gives me a **can-do** attitude as well as a steady inner drive.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs
If I'm silent or withdrawn

#### How to help
Help me to feel comfortable.  I feel comfortable when:
   1. I am familiar and at ease with the individuals I am with;
   1. The stated problem is clear enough and I have enough knowledge to provide feedback.
  - **Conflict**: I address conflict head on. I believe conflict establishes clear lines of thought and allows for an unequivocal dialogue to take place between myself and the others.

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

**How do you best receive feedback, be it positive or negative?**

  - Positive feedback: feedback in a private or group slack channel as well as team meetings is fair game! 
  - Negative feedback: 1-1s are the best and private slack channel. Provide an example of my actions or character.  That can help me learn.  

## Work Patterns

**What hours do you usually work?**

  - I work best in the morning
  - My work day usually starts at 8am 
  - Meetings are ideal 12pm-3pm PST.

**When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups?**

  - **Meetings**: Ideally, I like it when meetings have an agenda _with_ an expected outcome/decision.
  - **Learning**: I prefer to work things out on my own before reaching out for help. I will reach out to others to get ideas or when I have a question.
  - **Planning**: I prefer planning as a group;
  - **Development**: I like to code solo for the most part.  I will call upon help when I'm having a hard time debugging, or need a second pair of eyes when writing something.

**How do your energy levels fluctuate throughout the day?**

  - I have a lot of peaks and valleys in my day but typically the mornings are my peaks and I hit a valley after lunch but then I’ll peak again around 2pm or so.

## Communication Preferences
I prefer in person communication but COVID-19 has made me adapt to 
**Slack** for getting my attention.
If there is a long conversation needed or a constant back and forth of questions I prefer face to face video calls using Meet or Zoom. 
I try to respond to email within 24 hours. If you need a prompt response please slack me.

## Areas for Development

  - Asking questions that strike at the heart of the issue.  Sometimes I don't know what questions to ask to get a better understanding of context.
  - Android Development
- everything!!! I’m constantly learning and growing :) 

## Ask Me About

  - Chaplaincy
  - Traveling 
  - Food
